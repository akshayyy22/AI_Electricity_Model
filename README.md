# AI-Based Electricity Demand Projection System

## Overview

This project, developed for the Smart India Hackathon 2024, aims to revolutionize electricity demand forecasting and management using advanced AI techniques. By combining the power of machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, we have created a robust system capable of highly accurate predictions and real-time optimizations.

## Key Features

* **Hybrid AI Model:** Leverages a combination of Random Forest, ARIMA, LSTM, and CNN models to deliver superior forecasting accuracy.
* **Real-Time Adjustments:** Continuously updates forecasts based on live data streams, including weather, population, air quality index (AQI), and EV sales.
* **Reinforcement Learning & Agent-Based Modeling:** Enables dynamic power purchase decisions and grid allocation during peak demand or emergency situations.
* **Heatwave Prediction:** Improves peak demand forecasts, enhancing grid reliability during extreme weather conditions.
* **Scalable Forecasting:** Provides multi-scale predictions (daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, yearly) to optimize power distribution.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Offers a user-friendly interface for visualizing forecasts, analyzing trends, and making informed decisions.
